In some cases, the shopper simply does not understand the T&amp;C and fails to qualify for the offer due to the lack of understanding. In some other cases, the shopper cannot find a product required by an offer. In some other cases, the shopper simply misses the offer completely and remains unaware that an offer is available to the shopper.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="23" com:id="p-23">[0020]    These and many other shopping circumstances prevent offers to be effective to the advantage of shoppers, the retailer, or both. A shopper might either forego buying a product, might return a product, might realize too late that they could have taken additional actions to qualify for an offer, and the like. As a result, a retailer might lose a sale, incur a loss due to a returned product, and generally lose the intended advantage from advertising the offer.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="24" com:id="p-24">[0021]    The illustrative embodiments recognize that the presently available tools or solutions do not address these needs or provide adequate solutions for these needs.

For example, either prior to the shopper reaching the store for a shopping session, or when the shopper is present at the store, an embodiment receives one or more offer inputs. [0024]   An offer input is a manner of capturing the advertisement of an offer. For example, the offer may be advertised on a printed flyer, from which the offer input is captured in the form of a picture or image of all or a portion of the flyer. The offer input captured in this manner may be a picture of plain text, barcodes, encoded image such as QR codes, and the like, or some combination thereof. As another example, the offer may be advertised using a radio frequency identification (R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="5">F</uscom:OCRConfidenceData>ID) device, from which the offer input is captured in the form of a R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="588">FID</uscom:OCRConfidenceData> identifier. It is possible to capture and use the offer input in multiple forms - such as the picture form as well as the R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="5">F</uscom:OCRConfidenceData>ID form.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="28" com:id="p-28">[0025]   An embodiment analyzes the offer input to determine an offer identifier. For example, the offer identifier may be a textual code obtained from image analysis of textual data, decoded identifier from image analysis of a barcode or encoded image, identifier unpacked from the R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="5">F</uscom:OCRConfidenceData>ID transmission, or some combination thereof. One embodiment uses an external cognitive engine for performing a suitable analysis of the offer input and<uscom:BoundaryDataReference com:idref="HDR-00013"/></uscom:P><uscom:BoundaryDataReference com:idref="HDR-00014"/>

The cognitive system may be a standalone system or a part of a retailing backend system.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="31" com:id="p-31">[0026]    Once an offer identifier is obtained, an embodiment queries a retailing backend system of the store associated with the offer. Particularly, the query provides the retailing backend system the offer identifier and obtains a result set which includes the identifiers of one or more products that can potentially satisfy the offer.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="32" com:id="p-32">[0027]    In one embodiment, the product identifiers appear in one or more pre-arranged valid combinations with one another such that any of the one or more combinations is sufficient to satisfy the offer T&amp;C. A valid combination is a combination of one or more products that satisfies the T&amp;C of an offer.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="33" com:id="p-33">[0028]    In another embodiment, the cognitive system is used to analyze the offer input to further determine the one or more valid combinations. The embodiment then constructs the one or more combinations using the product identifiers received in the result set, and by referencing a product catalog.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="34" com:id="p-34">[0029]    For one or more products in a valid combination, one embodiment further determines whether the shopper's social network has expressed a social sentiment towards the product. A social network comprises a set of other users or subscribers of a social media platform. A social sentiment towards a product is social media data that is indicative of a like or dislike of the product by a member of the social network.</uscom:P><uscom:BoundaryDataReference com:idref="HDR-00015"/>

<?PageStart number='9'?><uscom:P com:pNumber="37" com:id="p-37">[0030]    To evaluate the social sentiment towards a product in a valid combination, an embodiment collects the shopper's social media data from the shopper's social media platform. Using existing social sentiment analysis techniques, the embodiment evaluates a social sentiment expressed towards the product in the social media data of the shopper. For example, a social media friend of the shopper may have expressed a favorable experience with the product, or written a bad review of the product, type of product, manufacturer of the product, etc. [0031]    Using the social sentiment corresponding to a product, an embodiment computes and assigns the product a social sentiment rating (interchangeably referred to simply as a product "rating"). A shopper may set a preferred product rating or an embodiment may be configured with a default social sentiment rating. As a non-limiting example, if the computed rating is on an example scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest, the default rating may be set to 5, or a shopper-specified rating threshold may be 7. An embodiment selects those valid combinations in which each participant product has the default or shopper- specified rating, as the case may be. [0032]    An embodiment further assists the shopper with locating a product that participates in a valid combination. For example, the result set may already include a location of the product with the product identifier of a product. The location may be an aisle and rack position within the store layout, a set of coordinates, or some other suitable manner of describing the location of the product within the store.</uscom:P><uscom:BoundaryDataReference com:idref="HDR-00017"/>

<?PageStart number='10'?><uscom:P com:pNumber="40" com:id="p-40">[0033]   Using the location of the product, an embodiment visualizes the store layout for the user and superimposes on the visualization the location of the product in a suitable manner. For example, in an augmented reality (AR) capability available on the shopper's device or peripheral, the embodiment can present a view of the store from the shopper's current perspective and graphically or textually overlay in the view the location of the product. An embodiment can be further configured to visually represent a product rating in the visualization of the product location.</uscom:P><uscom:P com:pNumber="41" com:id="p-41">[0034]   Another set of embodiments is configured to assist a shopper starting with a product that the shopper selects.

For example, the product input may be captured in the form of a picture or image of all or a portion of the product. The product input captured in this manner may be a picture of the product itself, plain text, barcodes, encoded image such as QR codes, and the like, or some combination thereof, present on the product. As another example, the product may have an R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="5">F</uscom:OCRConfidenceData>ID device associated therewith, from which the product input is captured in the form of a R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="5">F</uscom:OCRConfidenceData>ID identifier.

Particularly, the query provides the retailing backend system the product identifier and obtains a result set which includes the identifiers of one or more offers in which the product appears in a valid combination. [0038]    In some cases, the product may not be participating in any offers. In such cases an embodiment can be configured to alert the shopper than no offers are applicable to the product being considered. [0039]   When one or more offers are associated with the product, an embodiment proceeds with an offer identifier in a manner described herein. For example, the embodiment obtains from the retailing backend system a result set of products that can potentially satisfy the offer; produces valid combinations of the product and other products from the result set; computes product ratings of the product, the other product, or both, in a valid combination; locates the other product; visualizes the location and/or the rating of the other product; or performs some combination of these and other functions with respect to an offer, as described herein.</uscom:P><uscom:BoundaryDataReference com:idref="HDR-00021"/>

<?PageStart number='12'?><uscom:P com:pNumber="48" com:id="p-48">[0040]    Another set of embodiments is configured to assist a shopper starting with a set of products that the shopper has placed in a shopping cart. Assume that the shopping cart is enabled with technology to determine which physical products are physically placed in the physical shopping cart. For example, a barcode scanner coupled with the cart may scan a product as the product is placed in the cart. As another example, an R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="5">F</uscom:OCRConfidenceData>ID reader may read an R<uscom:OCRConfidenceData uscom:ocrConfidenceCode="588">FID</uscom:OCRConfidenceData> tag associated with a product that is placed in the cart. [0041]    These examples manners of capturing product input about the products present in the cart are not intended to be limiting.
